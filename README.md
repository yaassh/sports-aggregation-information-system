# Sports-aggregation-information-system

Sports Aggregator Information System is a uniquely designed system which has both expert and user interactive content focusing audiences from the range of novice to expert level sports enthusiasts. 

There are many existing information systems which are either expert systems or user interactive systems alone, but we have combined the features of both systems. Our information system will provide more specific content to the users by displaying the notifications, articles, match details etc., only of the sports the user is interested and subscribed to. 

Sports Aggregator Information System also has the provision for booking the tickets for different matches held across the globe. This system is a one stop solution for sports enthusiasts for score updates, player statistics, critical analysis, ticket booking. This system also has email notifications about a new match, any interesting move of the userâ€™s favorite sports person. 

In short, Sports Aggregator Information System has every information of sports required by sports enthusiasts under one system. This system covers 9 major international sports and has a future scope of increasing the number of sports further. 

As part of this project:
1. Initially, gathered the requirements from sports enthusiasts by posting questionnaire.
2. Designed UML diagrams (Use case, Class, State chart, Sequence and activity) for the System
3. Prepared an SRS document.
4. Designed an oracle database for the system with an ER diagram and Logical design
5. Developed PL/SQL packages, Functions and Procedures
6. On top of this database, developed an application using Microsoft Visual Studio tool, asp.Net framework and languages C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL and PL/SQL.
